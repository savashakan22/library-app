# library-app
It is a project that I made for my school library.
You should run the Library_GUI.py for it to work.

You can add books to a student register and bring the books to a "returned" state.
You can show the unreturned books of a student.

When using it enter the Name and Lastname of the student and then you can enter the other parts according to it
Before pressing the buttons make sure that the according entry boxes are written because there is no error management (yet.)

Show books button only shows the unreturned books of the student.
