# library-app
It is a project that I made for my school library.
You should run the Library_GUI.py for it to work.

You can add books to a student register and bring the books to a "returned" state
You can show the unreturned books of a student

When using it enter the Name and Lastname of the student and then you can enter the other parts according to it
